/* To use this file, duplicate it and name the new copy to "config.js"
    Put your keys into config.js, not this file.
    Note: config.js will be in the gitignore, so your keys won't be committed-
    so if you move machines and clone down the repo, you'll need to recreate the config.js file
    Thank you for your cooperation and any violation of this rule will be noted and reported to the authorities
